# From the Duckett JS & JQuery book



## JavaScript Object 


 JavaScript object  is a list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.Objects are a group of variables(properties) and functions(method)

**example of object** 

let myself = { age : 20, name : “someone” , talk: ()=> 
console.log(“I can talk wooow”) }

(myself.name) this is how to call a property from an object


//we use comma to seperate them

 object, variables = properties
 object, functions = methods

 # DOM
