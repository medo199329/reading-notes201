Jon Duckett's book, "HTML & CSS" is a great learning opportunity in the few pages I summarized I discussed the main points in a simple manner. 
In the first chapter, we had talked about lists. Lists in HTML are several types: unordered lists (UL) and ordered lists (OL)
while OL consists of numbers, UL consist of bullets which mean bold black dots.
In the next chapter we discussed boxes ; how CSS deals with HTML elements? It orders them in containers called boxes or code blocks
as in this example :
<section>
</section>
 This is called semantic because it gave meaning.

In order to control HTML elements, CSS uses special properties that start with a symbol (.)
before any class which we use, to change elements like size and color.


Now I will discuss John Duckett's Book, "JavaScript & jQuery"

Although JS has if statements, it also has else if statements. This is technically the same  but  (else if ) statement has a logical operation or argument in the (), but then if that condition isn't right, then the execution will fall into the else block: 
 if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
  } else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
  } else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
   }

there is also (switch statement), it is the same but differ in the syntax
